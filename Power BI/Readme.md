## üè∑Ô∏è Project Overview

This project aims to analyze [mention the subject, e.g., sales data, financial performance, customer behavior] from [mention the time period, e.g., 2022-2024] to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for business improvement. The interactive dashboard provides a clear and concise view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and allows for a deeper dive into the underlying data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for the entire workflow, including data connection, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized for creating complex calculations and custom measures.
- **Power Query:** Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation (ETL process).

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation

During the data preparation phase in Power Query, the following steps were taken:

- **Data Loading:** Connected to the data sources and loaded the tables.
- **Handling Missing Values:** [e.g., Removed rows with null values in the 'order_id' column].
- **Data Type Correction:** [e.g., Ensured 'order_date' was formatted as a Date type and 'sales_amount' as a Decimal Number].
- **Column Manipulation:** [e.g., Split the 'customer_name' column into 'first_name' and 'last_name'].
- **Calculated Columns:** [e.g., Created a 'profit' column by subtracting 'cost' from 'revenue'].

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Modeling

A relational data model was built in Power BI to connect the different data tables.

- **Relationships:** Established a one-to-many relationship between the `Customers` table and the `Sales` table on `CustomerID`.
- **DAX Measures:** Created several key measures to power the visualizations, such as:
    - `Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Revenue])`
    - `Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)`
    - `Year-over-Year Sales Growth = ...`

## üìä Visualizations and Dashboard

The final dashboard consists of multiple interactive visuals designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the data:

- **KPI Cards:** Displaying high-level metrics like Total Revenue, Total Profit, and Number of Customers.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** A line chart showing revenue trends over time, with slicers for year and month.
- **Product Performance:** A bar chart illustrating the top-performing products by sales.
- **Geographical Sales Map:** A map visual displaying sales distribution by state or country.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Filters for date, region, and product category to allow for dynamic data exploration.

## üí° Key Insights

The analysis revealed several key findings:

1.  **Insight 1:** [e.g., The West region consistently generated the highest sales, contributing to 40% of the total revenue in the last fiscal year.]
2.  **Insight 2:** [e.g., Product Category 'Electronics' has the highest profit margin, despite not being the top seller by volume.]
3.  **Insight 3:** [e.g., A significant dip in sales was observed during the month of February, which warrants further investigation.]

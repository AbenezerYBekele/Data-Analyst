## Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Market Trends
- Acquired and integrated time-series stock data and quarterly revenue data from multiple sources, utilizing the yfinance API for market data and Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup) for web scraping financial statements.
- Performed comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing on raw financial data using pandas, ensuring data integrity by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and performing data type conversions.
- Engineered and built comparative visualizations using matplotlib and plotly to illustrate the strong correlation between Tesla's revenue growth and its stock price, contrasting it with the sentiment-driven volatility of GameStop.
- Synthesized analytical findings into actionable insights, concluding that while strong fundamentals were indicative of Tesla's long-term value, external market events were the primary driver for GameStop's short-term price surge.

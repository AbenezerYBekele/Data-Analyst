## Chicago Urban Analysis
This data analysis project explores the relationships between socioeconomic factors, education metrics, and crime statistics across Chicago's community areas. Using SQL and Python, the analysis reveals key patterns that could inform urban policy decisions.
### Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (SQLite)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
## Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Market Trends
- Acquired and integrated time-series stock data and quarterly revenue data from multiple sources, utilizing the yfinance API for market data and Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup) for web scraping financial statements.
- Performed comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing on raw financial data using pandas, ensuring data integrity by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and performing data type conversions.
- Engineered and built comparative visualizations using matplotlib and plotly to illustrate the strong correlation between Tesla's revenue growth and its stock price, contrasting it with the sentiment-driven volatility of GameStop.
- Synthesized analytical findings into actionable insights, concluding that while strong fundamentals were indicative of Tesla's long-term value, external market events were the primary driver for GameStop's short-term price surge.

## Data Wrangling: Used Cars Pricing Analysis
- Executed a full data wrangling pipeline in Python and pandas, identifying and resolving issues in a raw dataset to ensure its quality and usability for analysis.
- Addressed data quality issues by implementing strategies for missing data imputation, using mean and frequency replacement techniques to handle numerical and categorical gaps.
- Standardized and normalized data for comparative analysis, converting categorical variables into numerical indicators (one-hot encoding) and scaling features like "length," "width," and "horsepower" to a common range.
- Performed feature engineering to create a new, more descriptive "horsepower-binned" variable, effectively transforming continuous data into a categorical feature to improve model interpretability.
- Conducted data formatting and type correction across the dataset, ensuring all columns were aligned with their appropriate data types (e.g., int, float, object) for analytical accuracy.
